# Instafilter
100 Days of Swift (Project 13) This app allows users to choose a picture from their photos, then manipulate it with a series of Core Image filters. Once they are 
satisfied, they can save the processed image back to their photo library. Throughout the course of this project, I had more practice with UIImagePickerController and 
became acquainted with UISlider, CIContext, CIFilter, and more.


In addition, I completed the following challenges:
-Try making the Save button show an error if there was no image in the image view.
-Make the Change Filter button change its title to show the name of the currently selected filter.
-Experiment with having more than one slider, to control each of the input keys you care about. For example, you might have one for radius and one for intensity.
