# Instafilter
100 Days of Swift (Project 13) This app allows users to choose a picture from their photos, then manipulate it with a series of Core Image filters. Once they are 
satisfied, they can save the processed image back to their photo library. Throughout the course of this project, I had more practice with UIImagePickerController and 
became acquainted with UISlider, CIContext, CIFilter, and more.


In addition, I completed the following challenges:
-Try making the Save button show an error if there was no image in the image view.
-Make the Change Filter button change its title to show the name of the currently selected filter.
-Experiment with having more than one slider, to control each of the input keys you care about. For example, you might have one for radius and one for intensity.

And the following (project 15) challenge: Go back to project 13 and make the image view fade in when a new picture is chosen. To make this work, set the alpha to 0 first.
